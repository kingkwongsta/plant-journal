# üå± EdenLog AI: The Intelligent Garden Journal

Log your garden's story, effortlessly. EdenLog AI transforms your simple photos and notes into a rich, structured database of your plant journey. Stop filling out forms and start journaling naturally. Our AI understands your language, identifies your plants, and tracks their lifecycle from seed to harvest.

Built with Next.js 15, FastAPI, and Supabase, and powered by a cutting-edge Large Language Model (LLM).

## ‚ú® Key Innovation: The AI Smart Log

The core of EdenLog AI is its ability to understand unstructured, conversational input. You no longer need to navigate menus or fill out forms.

**User Experience Flow:**

1.  **Capture the Moment:** Snap one or more photos of a plant (a harvest, a bloom, or just a daily check-in).
2.  **Add a Simple Note:** Write a short, freeform description like `"Harvested 5 big beefsteak tomatoes today, they look great!"` or `"First rose bloom of the season üåπ"` or simply `"Zucchini plant check-in"`.
3.  **Submit:** The app sends your images and text to the backend.
4.  **AI Magic:** Our LLM analyzes your input. It extracts the key entities:
      * **Event Type:** Harvest, Bloom, Snapshot, Watering, etc.
      * **Plant Name:** "Beefsteak Tomato", "Rose", "Zucchini"
      * **Quantity:** 5
      * **Qualitative Notes:** "they look great"
      * **Associated Media:** Links the uploaded photos to this event.
5.  **Structured Data:** The AI generates a structured JSON object, which is then saved to your database, creating a perfect, queryable log entry automatically.

**Example In Action:**

> **User Input:**
>
>   * *Uploads 3 photos of cherry tomatoes in a basket.*
>   * *Text:* `"First cherry tomato harvest of the year! Got a small basketful."`
>
> **LLM Output (sent to database):**
>
> ```json
> {
>   "event_type": "harvest",
>   "plant_variety_name": "Cherry Tomato",
>   "quantity": null, // or an estimated amount like "small basket"
>   "notes": "First harvest of the year!",
>   "photos": ["url_to_photo1.jpg", "url_to_photo2.jpg", "url_to_photo3.jpg"],
>   "event_date": "2025-08-14T21:19:43Z"
> }
> ```

## üåü Updated Features

### üçé Core Functionality

  - **AI-Powered Journaling**: Submit freeform text and photos; the LLM automatically structures and categorizes your entry as a harvest, bloom, or snapshot.
  - **Unified Garden Feed**: View all your logs‚Äîharvests, blooms, and snapshots‚Äîin a single, scrollable timeline, just like a social media feed for your garden.
  - **Automated Plant Journey**: The app automatically compiles all events for a specific plant into a complete lifecycle timeline, from planting to final harvest.
  - **Smart Search & Insights**: Ask natural language questions like `"How many tomatoes did I harvest last month?"` or `"Show me all my rose blooms"`.
  - **Weather Integration**: Automatically correlates each entry with historical weather data from Open-Meteo for deeper insights.
  - **Intelligent Photo Gallery**: Photos are automatically tagged by the LLM with plant name, event type, and date. View your garden's progress through four modes: Timeline, Garden View, Photo Wall, and Data Insights.
  - **Data Export**: Export your beautifully structured data for personal records or advanced analysis.

### üîß Technical Highlights

  - **AI/LLM Integration**: Core logic built around an LLM API (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4o) for natural language understanding and structured data generation.
  - **Prompt Engineering**: Sophisticated, context-aware prompt templates to ensure reliable JSON output from freeform user text.
  - **Modern Stack**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, FastAPI (Python), TypeScript.
  - **Real-time Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security to store the structured log data.
  - **Backend Orchestration**: FastAPI manages the flow: receives user input, calls the LLM API, processes the response, and commits the structured data to Supabase.
  - **Image Processing Pipeline**: On-upload, images are compressed, optimized, and stored (e.g., Supabase Storage), with their URLs linked in the database entry.
  - **Unified Event Architecture**: A single, powerful database table stores all event types (harvest, bloom, snapshot), differentiated by an `event_type` column for simple and efficient querying.
  - **Robust API**: Versioned, paginated RESTful API with comprehensive Pydantic validation for all incoming and outgoing data.
  - **Background Jobs**: Future-ready for tasks like generating weekly summary reports or AI-driven pest identification from photos.
  - **Enterprise-Grade Foundation**: Retains JWT-based auth, structured logging, health checks, comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E), and Dockerized deployment.

# Codebase Structure

## `backend/`

This directory contains the FastAPI application that powers the AI and data management features of EdenLog. The backend is responsible for processing user input, interfacing with the Large Language Model (LLM), and managing the database.

### `backend/app/`

The core of the backend application.

-   `main.py`: The main FastAPI application file. It defines all API endpoints, handles request validation with Pydantic, and orchestrates the logic for processing user input. This includes:
    -   Receiving image files and JSON data from the client.
    -   Uploading and hosting images on Google Cloud Storage.
    -   Calling a Large Language Model (LLM) API via OpenRouter with a carefully engineered prompt to parse unstructured text.
    -   Parsing the LLM's structured JSON response.
    -   Saving the final, structured data to a Google Cloud Firestore database.
    -   Providing standard CRUD endpoints for journal entries and other application data.

### `backend/` (Root)

-   `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies for the backend, such as `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `google-cloud-firestore`, and the `openai` client library (for OpenRouter).
-   `seed_api.py`: A utility script for seeding the database with initial data or for testing the API endpoints. It is not part of the main application flow.
-   `venv/`: The Python virtual environment directory. **The LLM should never modify the contents of this folder.**

---

## `client/`

This directory contains the Next.js frontend application. It's responsible for the user interface and for communicating with the backend API.

### `client/app/`

The main application directory, following the Next.js App Router structure.

-   `page.tsx`: The main landing page and primary user interface for creating journal entries. This is where users upload photos and write their notes.
-   `layout.tsx`: The root layout for the application. It includes the main HTML structure, global styles, and any shared UI components like a navigation bar.
-   `globals.css`: Global styles for the application, primarily using Tailwind CSS directives.
-   `admin/`: Contains the admin dashboard pages.
    -   `page.tsx`: The main admin dashboard page.
    -   `layout.tsx`: The layout for the admin section.

### `client/components/`

Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.

-   `ui/`: A collection of UI components, likely built using a library like ShadCN/UI. These are general-purpose components like `Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, etc.

### `client/lib/`

Contains utility functions and library code for the frontend.

-   `api.ts`: A key file that centralizes all communication with the backend API. It should contain typed functions for making API requests (e.g., `createJournalEntry`, `getJournalEntries`) and handle things like setting authentication headers.
-   `utils.ts`: A collection of miscellaneous utility functions used throughout the frontend.

### `client/public/`

Contains static assets like images, icons, and fonts.

### `client/` (Root)

-   `package.json`: Defines the project's dependencies, scripts (like `dev`, `build`, `start`), and other metadata.
-   `next.config.ts`: The configuration file for Next.js.
-   `tsconfig.json`: The TypeScript configuration file.
-   `postcss.config.mjs` & `tailwind.config.ts`: Configuration files for PostCSS and Tailwind CSS.

# Development Workflow

The `start-dev.sh` script in the root directory is used to start the development environment. It concurrently runs the Next.js development server and the FastAPI backend server.

-   The client runs on `http://localhost:3000`.
-   The backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`.
